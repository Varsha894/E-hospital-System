# E-hospital-System
Hospital System 
An e-hospital system, also known as a Hospital Management Information System (HMIS), is a comprehensive and integrated digital platform designed to manage all aspects of hospital operations. It digitizes the internal workflows and processes, connecting patients, hospitals, and doctors on a single platform. This system is a critical component of modern healthcare, aiming to improve service delivery, enhance efficiency, and provide better patient care.
Key Features and Modules
An e-hospital system is typically composed of various modules that address different functional areas of a hospital:
Patient Registration: Manages the registration process for both outpatients (OPD) and inpatients (IPD), assigning a unique patient ID (such as an Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) ID in India) to track all their visits and records.
Appointment and Scheduling: Allows patients to book, confirm, or cancel appointments online or at a counter, helping with crowd management and reducing wait times.
Inpatient Department (IPD) Management: Streamlines the entire process from admission to discharge. It handles bed allocation, doctor visits, orders, and services like dietary, laundry, and lab tests for admitted patients.
Outpatient Department (OPD) Management: Efficiently handles walk-in patients, manages consultations, and aids in providing swift outpatient care.
Electronic Health Records (EHR) / Electronic Medical Records (EMR): A central component that stores and manages a patient's complete medical history, including diagnoses, treatments, medications, and lab results. This ensures that all relevant data is easily accessible to healthcare providers.
Billing Management: Tracks all patient services and generates accurate bills, including room rent, consultation fees, lab tests, medications, and procedures.
Laboratory Information System (LIS) & Radiology Information System (RIS): Automates the process of ordering, scheduling, and reporting on lab tests and radiological procedures. It also helps in managing specimens and imaging data.
Pharmacy and Inventory Management: Tracks and manages medical supplies, medicines, and equipment, ensuring efficient stocking and reducing wastage.
Operation Theater (OT) Management: Automates the functions and workflows of the operating theaters within the hospital.
Telemedicine: Enables remote consultations, which can be especially beneficial during health crises or for patients in remote areas.
Patient Portal/Mobile Apps: Provides patients with secure online access to their health records, allowing them to book appointments, view lab reports, and communicate with healthcare providers.
